If you get to 	STEP FOUR: Open NI and bomb out at this error

	"sudo port install libusb-devel +universal

	--->  Configuring libusb-devel
	Error: Please do not install this port since it has been replaced by 'libusb'.
	"

Fixed by running

"sudo rm -f /opt/local/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib"
"sudo port clean libusb"
"sudo port install libusb +universal"

Basically the Mac install instructions need to be updated and should include a warning that the short install may leave files around that will need to be deleted before installing with port.
